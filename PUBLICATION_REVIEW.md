## Findings / 발견 사항

Personal host/user examples were generalized; no tracked bulk deletion required in this pass.

## Safe Public Scope / 공개 가능한 범위

- Generic source code, scripts, templates, and documentation after placeholder
  cleanup.
- Public-facing README/PROJECT/NOTICE metadata.
- Example environment files only when values are placeholders.

## Excluded Or Conditional Scope / 제외 또는 조건부 범위

- Real secrets, private account data, machine state, session logs with private
  operational content, generated outputs with unclear rights, and third-party
  assets without clear permission.

## Verification Plan / 검증 계획

- Run `git diff --check`.
- Run the narrowest project-native command available.
- Confirm `README.md`, `PROJECT.md`, `NOTICE.md`, `LICENSE`, and this review file
  exist before changing visibility.
## Verification Results / 검증 결과

git diff --check: pass. bash -n scripts/*.sh: pass. Direct identity/path pattern scan: pass except .git worktree pointer.
